  99 Bottles of Beer

  In this puzzle, write code to print out the entire "99 bottles of 
  beer on the wall" song. For those who do not know the song, the lyrics 
  follow this form:

  X bottles of beer on the wall
  X bottles of beer
  Take one down, pass it around
  X-1 bottles of beer on the wall

  X-1 bottles of beer on the wall
  ...
  Take one down, pass it around
  0 bottles of beer on the wall

  Where X and X-1 are replaced by numbers of course. Grammatical support for 
  "1 bottle of beer" is optional. As with any puzzle, try to do it in as 
  creative/concise/comical a way as possible (simple, obvious solutions allowed, too).
